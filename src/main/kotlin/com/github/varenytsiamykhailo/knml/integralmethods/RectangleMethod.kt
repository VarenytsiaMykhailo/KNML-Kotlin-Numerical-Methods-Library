/**
 * Rectangle method implementation.
 *
 * The method of rectangles is a method of numerical integration of a function of one variable,
 * which consists in replacing the integrand with a polynomial of degree zero, that is, a constant, on each elementary segment.
 * If we consider the graph of the integrand, the method will consist in the approximate calculation of the area under
 * the graph by summing the areas of a finite number of rectangles,
 * the width of which will be determined by the distance between the corresponding neighboring integration nodes,
 * and the height - by the value of the integrand at these nodes.
 *
 * Asymptotic complexity: O(n^2 * T(integralFunction)), where T - asymptotic complexity of the integral function.
 * For example, if the asymptotic complexity of the integral function is O(n^3),
 * then the asymptotic complexity of the rectangle method will be O(n^2 * n^3) = O(n^5)
 *
 * Use [solveIntegralByRectangleMethod] method to solve the integral.
 *
